This is the landing repository for the .NET foundation efforts. If you are interested in participating in the foundation's efforts, this is the repository for you!

## Purpose
This repository serves the following purposes:

1. __Provide a place to file actionable issues as a result of action group discussions.__ We can assign issues to accountable owners and hopefully see progress.
2. __A place to document some of the decisions and results from our action group discussions in the form of markdown documents.__ Many of our decisions probably should be documented in the website, but some of our internal processes are better documented in a repo.
3. Provide a landing page for people looking to get involved.

## Action Groups!

The best way to get involved is to join the foundation and sign up for an action group! __TODO: Add details on how to do that__ Action groups use GitHub discussions to plan activities, but the actionable items that result from those discussions will be logged here.

If you have a suggestion for how the .NET Foundation can improve its efforts, log an issue!
